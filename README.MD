# HOW TO USE
 I wrote programs in python3, so you have to run by using python 3. I'm using this following command to run...
```
$ python3 example.py
```
## Letter Frequency Analysis
This is letter frequency analysis program. Once you enter cipher text, it will show you letter frequency of that cipher text compare to letter frequency from Introduction to modern cryptography book and from website that I forgot to bookmark (if I found, I will update here).

First you have to enter your cipher text by passing argument in command line like this
```
$ python3 letterFrequencyAnalysis.py cat is funny
```
or you can run program normally
```
$ python3 letterFrequencyAnalysis.py
Enter Cipher Text
    cat is funny
```
then it will show letter frequency like this
```
Ciphertext
    cat is funny

as you can see if your ciphertext is plaintext, the decrypt message should exacly equals your input, i.e. your cipher text. For example it should be...
```
Ciphertext
    cat is funny

Decrypt Message 1
    cat is funny

Decrypt Message 2
    cat is funny
```
because the length of ciphertext isn't long enough. Now you can edit your decrypt message by typing command like this...
```
1a=c

you will see that the letter 't' form decrypt message 1 changed to letter 'c', and also decrypt message 2. The '1' from '1a=c' means the decrypt message 1, and 'a=c' means change all letter 'a' to letter 'c'. so '1a=c' means change all letter 'a' form decrypt message 1 to letter 'c'. But you will notice that the decrypt message 2 is also affected. 

And if you type '2s=u', you will see this...
```
2s=u
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ciphertext
    cat is funny

Decrypt Message 1
    cts in oueer

Decrypt Message 2
    cth ni oueer
```
and if you type 'q' or 'Q', the program will quit. Now you understand how this program work so you can try to enter different ciphertext and different command. Or you can study my code - that's not very clean because this is my first serious python program I wrote.

## Shift Cipher
Shift cipher is the cipher that shift letter by the key. For instance, key is 2 so 'a' will be shift to 'c', 'z' shift to 'b'.

There are 2 main ways to run my program. First you pass 1 argument to select mode (0 = encryption mode, 1 = decryption mode).
```
$ python3 shift.py 0
Plaintext: dog is adorable
Key: 11

Ciphertext: ozr td lozclmwp
```
```
$ python3 shift.py 1
Ciphertext: ozr td lozclmwp
Key: 11

Plaintext: dog is adorable
```
or you can run by pass no agrument, this will be encryption mode.
```
$ python3 shift.py
Plaintext: dog is adorable
Key: 11

Ciphertext: ozr td lozclmwp
```
as you can see, passing agrument '0' or pass no agrument, it's the same. Because I think people - including me - want to encrypt message first, then decrypt it.

Another way to run my program is to pass 3 agruments, i.e., message, key and mode. But you can also pass only 2 agrument, message and key, to use encryption mode, but only limitation is that you can't type space between message.
```
$ python3 shift.py abcdef 3
defghi
```
```
$ python3 shift.py defghi 3 1
abcdef
```

## Affine Cipher
Affine cipher is the cipher that use function y = Ax + B (mod 26) (y = ciphertext, x = plaintext, A = first key, B = second key). To decrypt it, use x = (y - B) * inverse(A) this means 'A' must have modular multiplicative inverse (in mod 26). So gcd(A, 26) must be 1, i.e., 'A' must be in this set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25}.

Again, there're 2 main ways to run my program. First, you run program by passing one agrument or pass nothing to select mode (0 = encryption mode, 1 = decryption mode or pass no agrument to select encryption mode).
```
$ python3 affine.py
Plaintext: Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemuhwem Osas
Key: 11 25

Ciphertext: Lwlwhrwhrwhr Xmdrarmdrwhr Lnhrblyhrb Xpzp
```
```
$ python3 affine.py 0
Plaintext: Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemuhwem Osas
Key: 11 25

Ciphertext: Lwlwhrwhrwhr Xmdrarmdrwhr Lnhrblyhrb Xpzp
```
```
$ python3 affine.py 1
Ciphertext: Lwlwhrwhrwhr Xmdrarmdrwhr Lnhrblyhrb Xpzp
Key: 11 25

Plaintext: Uvuvwevwevwe Onyetenyevwe Ugwemuhwem Osas
```
And another way to run my program is passing message, keys and mode in command line argument. Also you can pass only message and keys to use encryption mode.
```
$ python3 affine.py passwordisadmin123 9 12
rmsscijngsmnqgz123
```
```
$ python3 affine.py rmsscijngsmnqgz123 9 12 1
passwordisadmin123
```
